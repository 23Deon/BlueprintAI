          Wix is a popular website builder that allows users to build all kinds of websites, 
          ranging from personal blogs, company websites to storefronts. Website creation is done 
          entirely through the editing studio, without the user needing to write code at all.  
          Wix extends the website creation concept further by allowing users to host their websites 
          on Wix’s domain, and review analytics such as viewer traffic. In 2016, Wix embarked on implementing 
          AI for website design [1] and currently features AI tools that aid in section creation and text generation.

          Microsoft PowerPages is a platform designed for rapid website development, offering a user-friendly drag-and-drop 
          interface builder that enables users to create applications with ease. The platform leverages 
          AI-assisted UI recommendations to enhance the design process. 
          PowerPages seamlessly integrates with a variety of backend services such as its Dataverse 
          storage capabilities, security authentication features and analytics functionalities [2]. 
          One key feature of PowerPages that set it apart from more mainstream website creators is its ability to export the code in HTML, CSS and JavaScript, 
          the user can then further edit the code [3].

          Visily is highly similar to other website builders like Wix but has much more capabilities and functionalities. 
          Besides webpages, Visily can also create mobile phone pages, wireframes and mockups. The use of AI is also more prominent and 
          wider in Visily as compared to Wix as Visily allows the user to upload screenshots of existing UI to kickstart the generation process, 
          a welcomed feature from the usual description/ text based prompts that Wix offers. Visily supports multi-page generation and a
          multi-page view as shown below which gives a more holistic view of the user’s design.

          Our first project brief stated that we were to improve upon a project made by a group of 
          UCL postgraduate students in 2024 for their IXN module titled Microsoft Copilot UI v1.0. 
          The scope of this was largely similar to Blueprint AI, with the main feature of incorporating 
          AI to generate, edit and export user interfaces all within a VSCode extension. 
          Our initial brief wanted us to explore, using the existing codebase, other frameworks 
          for exporting the frontend designs into frontend frameworks. <br><br>
          The link to the entire repository can be found in [5], including a demo video of that project.

          <strong>Overview of Microsoft Copilot UI v1.0</strong> <br><br>

          Copilot UI v1.0 is a webview-based React editor integrated into a VSCode Extension, 
          primarily written in Typescript. The main backend code, consisting of the main program 
          logic (API calls, testing, JSON tree conversion) is located in the src directory while 
          the frontend of v1.0 is found in the webview-ui directory.  The system architecture of 
          v1.0 is shown in Figure 1, this is taken directly from the GitHub repository. The key 
          features of the project and brief explanations are listed in the table below.

          <u>1. Good system architecture</u><br><br>
          The system architecture (Figure 1) is well-thought out and planned suitably to meet the requirements of the project. This gave us some semblance of structuring and organising such a complicated system.
          The VSCode extension structure can be replicated and modeled for our version of the project as it relies on the existing, well-documented VSCode API library [6].
          Figure 2 shows a code snippet taken from the file in: <u>src/generateLayout/generateLayout.ts</u> <br><br>
          This file, along with other similar files found in the generateLayout directory was useful as 
          it allowed us to adapt our project based on this similar structure of importing the AI API library 
          and component types, making API calls to OpenAI. Furthermore, we can also improve on the meta prompts 
          (Figure 2, line 10) beyond just safety and ethics, to use them to refine the generated node tree. 
          Meta prompts are an excellent way of guiding large language models to perform complex tasks and reasoning 
          in a more methodical and logical way [8]. Based on the research paper in [8], we can leverage the use of 
          meta prompts to generate more refined and tailored results for the user.

          <u>2. Choice of Frameworks</u><br><br>
          The implementation of widely-used, industry relevant frameworks such as React and WinUI helped us to scope our research more clearly. 
          This gave us a good sense of what we could start exploring and looking into without having to write our own components from scratch. 
          This is discussed further in <strong>section 2: Technology Review.</strong><br><br>
          This project was a useful example of the existing frameworks we can use, where v1.0 
          highlights the ability to successfully implement such frameworks into our version - 
          with the method of exporting to HTML + CSS and WinUI frameworks being evident with v1.0. 
        </p>

        <p>
          <u>Conclusion</u><br><br>
          Version 1.0 gave us a good starting point and provided enough direction and structure 
          to aid us in our research and development process. It gave us confidence that programming
           a system like this is feasible. In particular, the frameworks and design decisions made gave 
           us a reference point and insight on how it could be implemented, especially the exporting of 
           UI designs into various frontend frameworks and also structuring our output using data structures like node trees. 
        </p>

        <p style="font-size: 1.5em;"><strong>Pain points</strong></p>
        <p><u>1. Complex Directory Structure</u></p>
        <p>
          While the system architecture design provided a clear high level overview of the system, 
          the directory structure of v1.0 is complex and difficult to navigate. Several issues 
          stood out which made understanding the system more challenging. <br><br>

          There were multiple nested folders containing different functionalities, 
          causing a bloated folder hierarchy. For instance, the tests (<strong>__tests__</strong>) 
          were located in the backed folder (/src) and this folder included more folders containing different 
          types of tests. A modular approach can be employed for our version, to reduce folder sprawl and improve 
          organisation [9]; thereby enabling our system to be scalable and extendable.<br><br>

          Additionally, several files included were obsolete and design decisions that were not 
          made were left in the source code. This made the directory structure unnecessarily convoluted. 
          It is evident that the group attempted to integrate some form of GitHub Copilot calls in the 
          backend but was ultimately abandoned. While there was some explanation of what this feature 
          could potentially be, the implementation was partially done with boilerplate code (Figure 3). 
          As such, this code served no purpose but to make the source code files more complicated.

        <p><u> Figure 3. Abandoned code for integrating Copilot left in source code</u></p>

        <p><u>2. Nested components and mixed UI logic</u></p>
        <p>
          Some crucial components of the code were written with nested components, incorporating mixed UI logic in the program. 
          This poor programming practice made deciphering the program logic more tedious and also harder to maintain, scale and test. 
          One main culprit is the <strong>MainWebviewPanel.ts</strong> program that manages a webview panel in the VSCode extension. 
          This class is responsible for creating, displaying, and handling interactions with the webview panel, 
          which is a vital component of the system - yet landed itself to the aforementioned faults. <br><br>

          The <strong>_setWebviewMessageListener</strong> method in <strong>MainWebviewPanel.ts</strong> contains a large switch statement with
          deeply nested logic for handling various commands (Figure 4). Each case in the switch statement performs 
          complex operations, such as: Fetching API keys, Saving and loading files, Processing sketches and text 
          descriptions, etc. This, among other issues, makes the method too long and complex, which reduces r
          eadability and maintainability. <br><br>

        <p style="font-size: 1.5em;"><strong>Verdict</strong></p>

        <p>
          While v1.0 provided a sufficient basis to scope our research and structure our project, 
          some major issues such as the complex directory structure and complicated code logic made 
          it difficult to extend v1.0. As such, we made the difficult but necessary decision to <strong>redo the system</strong> 
          from scratch in our own way. Though this may seem like a poor decision in terms 
          of time, redoing the system allowed us to overcome the issues v1.0 faced with the fundamental 
          design of the system, thereby allowing us greater flexibility in implementing better, more robust 
          features. With a more modular approach and design for our version, we can ensure greater maintainability,
          reusability, scalability and abstraction. A version that emphasizes the SOLID principles [10] will 
          greatly improve system architecture, allowing for future COMP0016 groups to extend our project with 
          more ease than it took us to understand v1.0’s system.
