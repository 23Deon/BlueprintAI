            <h2>UI Design Overview</h2>
            <p>
                Given that our project is targeted to a wide range of users, from programmers to designers — all with
                different levels of experience — we designed a UI that caters to these groups.
                A careful balance was considered to create a UI that allows experienced designers ample avenues for
                customization while keeping it intuitive for general users.
            </p>
            <p>
                We referenced **popular design products** such as Wix and Canva, using **Jakob Nielsen’s 10 Usability
                Heuristics** to guide our design process.

            <h2>Design Principles</h2>
            <p>We followed several key usability principles to ensure an optimal user experience:</p>

                        <td>Only relevant information is displayed in the sidebar to maintain clarity.</td>
                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>

            <p>Additionally, we took inspiration from Wix and Canva’s **top bar design**, which contains crucial
                project-level controls.</p>

            <h2>AI Integration in UI</h2>
            <p>
                Unlike traditional UI builders, **BlueprintAI deeply integrates AI** into the interface design process.
                Instead of relegating AI to the corner (as seen in Wix/Canva), our **AI Chatbox System** is
                **prominently featured** while maintaining easy-to-use customization features.
            </p>

            <table>

        <section>
            <h2>Sketches</h2>
            <p>
                We created several hand-drawn **sketches** in the early stages of the project, allowing for rapid
                iteration based on user feedback.
            </p>

            <h3>Design A</h3>
            <p>
                **AI prompter positioned on the side** with a **portrait chat log**. This design was inspired by
                chatbot-style UIs such as ChatGPT.
            </p>
            <img src="designA.png" alt="Design A Sketch">

            <h3>Design B</h3>
            <p>
                **AI prompter positioned at the bottom**, and chat history accessed through a button.
            </p>
            <img src="designB.png" alt="Design B Sketch">

            <h3>Final Decision</h3>
            <p>
                Users preferred **Design A**, as it provided clearer AI responses while showing UI changes in real time.
                Improvements included:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Adding a **confirmation button** for AI-generated changes.</li>
                <li>Keeping **all essential buttons** (download, pages, widgets) on one side for **better
                    organization**.</li>
                <li>Adding a **search bar** for improved usability.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Wireframe Prototype</h2>
            <p>
                Based on the refined sketches, we developed a **high-fidelity wireframe** that allowed us to visualize
                and finalize the UI layout.

            <p>Severity Ratings:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>0:</strong> Not a usability problem</li>
                <li><strong>1:</strong> Cosmetic problem (low priority)</li>
                <li><strong>2:</strong> Minor usability issue (fix if time permits)</li>
                <li><strong>3:</strong> Major usability issue (high priority)</li>
                <li><strong>4:</strong> Critical usability issue (must be fixed before launch)</li>
