      <h2>UI Design Overview</h2>
      <p>Given that our project is targeted to a wide range of users, from programmers to designers - 
        all with different levels of experience; 
        we had to design a UI that would cater to these different groups. 
        A careful balance was considered to create a UI that allowed for 
        experienced designers to have ample avenues to compose and customise but 
        not inundate regular users with too many features. Similarly, the UI needed to 
        be intuitive but at the same time, not compromise on the application’s capabilities. 
        </p>

      <p>
        We referenced highly popular design products such as Wix and Canva, 
        using Jakob Nielson’s 10 Usability Heuristics for UI Design to guide our design process [1].
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="design-principles-subsection" class="mt-4">
      <h2>Design Principles</h2>
      <p>Canva’s editing studio affords an elegant UI design that fulfills many of Nielson’s Usability Heuristics. 
        In particular, the side tab which contains all the editing features, from adding elements to text, is clearly 
        and concisely nested on the left. This creates a functional, non-cluttered layout. Additionally, 
        the structure that side tabs afford allows for Information Architecture (IA) to be practised. 
        IA is an essential design principle that breaks down complicated and complex interfaces into logical, 
        useful components that users can use to accomplish their tasks [2]. Furthermore, we took heavy cues 
        from a well-researched Medium article detailing the essential features a side tab must have, especially
        from its width and size - for space optimisation - and a quick search feature- for maximum efficiency and convenience [3].

        </div>
      </section>
        <p>
          We also took direction from the top bars of Wix and Canva. 
          These bars contained crucial project level information and essential functions 
          needed for the user to save, publish, undo their work. The buttons were clearly 
          labelled or had icons that were established and commonly recognised for users - 
          which is highly effective in conveying important information to the user without 
          taking up much space [4]. Additionally, on the top bar of the Wix page, the buttons 
          to toggle between computer view and mobile phone view were ingeniously formatted - 
          with this being a key feature of our project, we followed Wix’s stylish incorporation. 
          This design was also incorporated into our sketches and eventually the final UI design of our project.

        <p>
          We improved and innovated on the AI features in Wix and Canva. 
          Since one of the main selling points of Blueprint AI is the use 
          and integration of AI into the UI development and design process, 
          we expanded upon the AI functionality in the UI and revamped its
          visibility, usability and accessibility. 
        </p>

        <p>
          For Wix and Canva, AI was not a prominent feature and is relegated into the corner of 
          the left sidebar, shifting the focus onto the user’s own input and customisation. 
          Furthermore, the use of AI is severely limited and restricted. As we envisioned 
          AI to be woven seamlessly and tailored into all aspects of UI creation, 
          we deployed an AI chat bot system which is featured prominently in the UI whilst 
          maintaining the main customisation features a user can apply. We ensured that the 
          chat box design also adhered to key UI principles by relying on visual cues such as a 
          <b>‘Blueprint AI is typing…’</b> indicator to alert the user that their prompt is being handled [5]. 
          These subtle cues guide the user through using the chatbot effectively.

      <h2>Sketches</h2>
      <p>Sketches were generated at the early conception stages of the project. 
        These sketches were a quick way to actualise our ideas into concrete 
        concepts without getting too carried away on the implementations of these ideas [6]. 
        Revisions and edits could be done easily, which allowed us to gather user feedback faster and 
        update our designs more efficiently.</p>

      <p>
        We tested two competing sketches with users to get their input and 
        selected the one which was rated more positively with users, as part of 
        our user-centred design process.
