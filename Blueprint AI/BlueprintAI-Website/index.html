            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>
                The ability to design front-end user interfaces has traditionally been reserved for those with coding
                expertise, requiring knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and UI/UX principles. However, the advent of
                <strong>Generative AI</strong> has revolutionized this space, enabling both technical and non-technical
                users to create intuitive, aesthetically pleasing web interfaces effortlessly.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>BlueprintAI</strong> is a cutting-edge <em>generative drag-and-drop AI</em> tool that empowers
                users to build front-end designs without writing a single line of code. By integrating <strong>machine
                    learning models</strong> with an <strong>interactive UI builder</strong>, BlueprintAI offers
                <em>real-time component generation</em>, <em>intelligent design recommendations</em>, and <em>adaptive
                    customization</em> to streamline the UI development process.
            </p>
            <p>
                Users can describe their design intentions in <strong>natural language</strong>, and BlueprintAI
                translates these prompts into <strong>ready-to-use UI components</strong> that can be edited, resized,
                and positioned using an intuitive <em>drag-and-drop editor</em>. Advanced AI capabilities ensure that
                every generated layout maintains <strong>responsive design</strong>, <strong>visual
                    consistency</strong>, and <strong>industry-standard UI/UX best practices</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
                BlueprintAI is <strong>ideal for developers, designers, and businesses</strong> looking to create
                professional interfaces quickly. By reducing reliance on manual coding and bridging the gap between
                <em>design thinking</em> and <em>technical execution</em>, BlueprintAI accelerates front-end
                development, making website and app design more accessible than ever before.
            </p>
            <p>
